    "# Developing Reusable Code in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In research projects, the analytical process often involves multiple, interconnected steps, such as data cleaning, model building, and visualization, where each step depends on the previous one. Managing these dependencies efficiently is crucial for maintaining organized and reproducible research. To streamline such workflows, developing reusable code in Jupyter notebooks is essential. By breaking down complex processes into reusable components—such as functions, configuration settings, or entire notebooks—researchers can ensure consistency, reduce redundancy, and focus on the analysis itself rather than rewriting code for each step. In this notebook, we will explore key techniques for developing reusable code, including the use of magic commands to manage notebook execution, running and sequencing notebooks from one another, and importing code from one notebook to another to treat them like modular scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by looking at magic commands to manage notebooks, how to use notebook's interactive nature to build functions, how to sequence of notebooks from another notebook, how to import contents of notebook like it was a script. "
